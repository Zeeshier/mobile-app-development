# Flutter Project Structure

### Principal Folders
* **android/**: Stores Android native code and configurations like Gradle files and the AndroidManifest.
* **ios/**: Holds iOS native code and settings such as Info.plist.
* **lib/**: The heart of the project where all Flutter and Dart source code lives. 
* **test/**: Dedicated to unit and widget testing.
* **build/**: Contains compiled outputs like APK or IPA files.

### Key Configuration Files
* **pubspec.yaml**: The most important configuration file used to manage app metadata, dependencies, and assets.
* **main.dart**: Located in the `lib/` folder, this is the entry point of the Flutter application.
* **.gitignore**: Specifies which system or runtime-generated files should be excluded from version control.
